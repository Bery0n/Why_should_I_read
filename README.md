# Why Should I Read?
This project aims to create responsive and accessible static websites. It provides a range of solutions for basic level frontend development in HTML, XHTML, and CSS.
The content is currently written in Hungarian but will soon be updated with an English translation.

## Topic
The choice was open to pick a topic for the page, so I chose to advertise the positive effects of reading and created a top 5 recommended book series list. Each series has its own page to introduce the author(s) and itself. The list includes:
- Assassin's Creed
- Harry Potter
- Game Of Thrones
- Narnia
- Percy Jackson

## Simple Static Website
This project includes all basic elements of a static website, such as:
- Navigation bar and hamburger menus
- Hyperlink, picture, and video usage
- Full application form
- Design by CSS

## Responsiveness
The website is developed responsively with two layouts for different window sizes: one for laptop screens and one for smaller ones like smartphones. This responsiveness is at a basic level but functions correctly and may be updated.

## Accessibility
The design is based on high contrast between text and background and a larger font size for better readability. Each picture and video includes alternative text to inform visually impaired users if they use reading assistance software. Furthermore, on the Harry Potter page, below the videos, a link provides an example of full audio description for the Hufflepuff video.
